= Excellence =
'''Our One Rule is to Be Excellent to Each Other.'''

(What does that mean?  How does the Anti-Harassment Policy fit into this?  Are we SURE we know what being Excellent is?  This is an important and fundamental conversation at Noisebridge, so let's give it like 120 seconds.)
Ryan: would some explain what excellence is
Ryan: you don't need to be nice, but excellent to everyone, respect people, respect the space, be decent what ever you are, no harassment, if someone looks like need help, try helping, keep Noisebridge a place 

= Participation =
'''Everyone at Noisebridge is a participant at Noisebridge.'''

(What does that mean?  How do you get a door key? Access to Slack, Discuss, etc?)

Marco- many ways, help clean the space, help others, run events, help other event, mantain mahines, donate, always have a balance of give and take, alway rember to help yourself, don't yourself out, don't let Noisebridge become the one and only thing for you
Ryan: be excellent, participate, most things are done by DO-ocrazy & small C consensus (talk with other people arround you and check if change is ok for them). When you come a few times and are trusted, you can ask for 30 day access token (can be renued), you can also participate via Slack http://noisebridge.slack.com and discuss http://discuss.noisebridge.info, help with the wiki https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge

= [[Philanthropist|Philanthropists]]=
'''A Philanthropist at Noisebridge has earned enough trust from the community to open and close the space.'''
Ryan: philanthropist is commited to space in a way to use the space as much as possible, is a trust level with 24/7 hours access to space, but also know how to close/open the space, how to give a tour, donate monthly (default: 80$, starving hacker: 40$, other possible as well, talk with treasurer), have a sponsor. Become a philanthropist by filling out the pledge
Marry: Donate now
Ryan: Aditya applied, I sponsor him, will ask you some questions
Ryan: We will come back to it in a second, next membership
(continue)
Ryan: questions for Aditya: what do you enjoy at Noisebridge:
Aditya: everyone beeing excellent to me & vice versa
Ryan: how do you think Noisebridge can improve?
Aditya: space getting cleaner
Ryan: what projects do you work on?
Aditya: electronics, reading
Ryan: more questions? (no) anyone against him becoming a member


(What does that mean? What do we expect from Philanthropists? How do you become one? etc)


= [[ Membership Binder ]] =
'''Membership in Noisebridge entails community Trust in Consensus.'''

Ryan: Membership is highest trust level at Noisebridge, requires you to be even more present, you are part of the immune system to prevent the space gets burned down. Takes 2 other member sponsoring you, takes big c consensus + cooling down period, you are allowed to block big c consensus items as member.
Marco: minimum num of members for big c consensus?
Ryan: not clear.


(What does that mean? What do we expect from Members? How do you become a Member? etc)


= Financial Report =
'''Anarchist societies under a capitalist state need money to survive and thrive, yo.'''
Ryan: treasurer not here but recently about 3 weeks ago we had 170.000$ in the bank, good but not great if we need to move in a few years - would need a lot more money.
Ryan: fundraising on hold, maybe a fundraising event later this month

* Funds in bank:
* Noisetor (See the bulletpoints at the bottom of http://noisetor.net/finances/#summary):
* Any other details by those participating in handling our financials
* The latest financial reports from the treasurer are available at https://noisebridge.net/wiki/Finances

== Fundraising Update ==
'''How's it all going'''

= Consensus =
'''Consensus is how the Noisebridge Membership may change how Noisebridge works.'''
Ryan: big c consensus substentially change noisebridge. example: buy new lasertube. Announcement for 2 weeks, then decision meeting. Blocking a big c is a BIG thing, it means Noisebridge is dead for you if this passes.
Ryan: Last week 3 consensus items, unheard of before!
Ryan: Again... very rare

(How does Consensus work? What types of things are good for formal Consensus? What is small-c consensus? What is a "block"?)
